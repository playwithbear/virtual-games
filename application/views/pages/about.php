            'Virtual Games' is a project created by <a href="http://www.jonmccallum.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jon McCallum</a>, a Scout leader and web developer in response to the shutdown of face-to-face scouting.
            The idea is to create a library of games that can be shared and played with a larger number of people in the browser, either through simply sharing a screen in an Zoom call, or through interactions on each participant's device.

        <p>Although this is a labour of love I am definitely not, as you can probably tell, a designer. If you happen to be a front-end web developer (or a backend developer), and want to contribute games or prettification to the project, please get in touch from the <a href="https://github.com/playwithbear/virtual-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Repo</a>.</p>
